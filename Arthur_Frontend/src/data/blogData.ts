There’s something undeniably comforting about biting into a warm, toasty sandwich. 
At Arthur Sandwich House, we believe sandwiches are more than just quick bites—they’re experiences. 
Whether you’re feeling nostalgic or adventurous, there’s a sandwich waiting for you.

Take our Classic Grilled Cheese, for example—melty cheddar tucked between two slices of buttery, golden bread. 
Simple? Yes. Boring? Never.

Craving something bold? Try our Spicy Chicken Panini, layered with tangy sauce and fresh veggies, 
grilled to perfection with just the right amount of crunch.

For vegetarians, our Paneer Tandoori Sandwich combines smoky marinated paneer with cool mint chutney—
a flavor explosion you won’t forget.

We use fresh ingredients, artisan bread, and secret spice mixes to make each sandwich stand out. 
No shortcuts, no fillers—just honest, hearty food made with love.

Next time you’re at our place, ask us for the ‘Sandwich of the Week’—it’s where we get creative with seasonal ingredients and surprise twists!`

Wraps are the real MVPs of lunchtime—easy to carry, packed with flavor, and always satisfying. 
At Arthur Sandwich House, we’re redefining wraps as more than just a “healthy option.” They’re flavor-packed rolls of joy.

Our Mexican Veggie Wrap is a customer favorite—spiced beans, corn, lettuce, salsa, and a drizzle of chipotle mayo. 
It’s bold, bright, and bursting with texture.

Or go protein-packed with our Chicken Caesar Wrap, made with freshly grilled chicken breast, crisp romaine, 
house Caesar dressing, and a sprinkle of parmesan—all wrapped in a soft tortilla.

Want something lighter? Try our Hummus & Grilled Veggie Wrap—a vegan delight that’s creamy, crunchy, and wholesome.

Our wraps are made fresh daily, and we offer gluten-free options too. Whether you want something light for lunch 
or a power-packed meal on the move, we’ve got a wrap for that.

Pro tip: Pair it with one of our coolers or iced teas for the ultimate midday refreshment.`

    There’s no better way to beat the heat than with a tall, frosty milkshake or a scoop of homemade ice cream. 
    At Arthur Sandwich House, we take dessert seriously—and our milkshakes and ice creams are made to indulge.
    
    Our Choco-Overload Shake is a chocolate lover’s dream. Thick, creamy, and topped with whipped cream, 
    chocolate chips, and a drizzle of hot fudge—it’s practically dessert and a drink in one.
    
    Looking for something fruity? Our Mango Madness Shake, made with real Alphonso mangoes, is sunshine in a glass.
    Refreshing, sweet, and perfect on a hot day.
    
    And if you’re an ice cream fan, don’t miss our in-house scoops—like Vanilla Bean Crunch or Fresh Strawberry Swirl.
    No artificial flavors, just real ingredients and old-fashioned churning.
    
    We even offer seasonal specials—like our Rose Falooda Shake during summer or the Spiced Caramel during the holidays.
    
    Come treat yourself. Life’s too short to skip dessert. 🍦`
